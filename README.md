# SnakesAndLadders
This is a console game to play inspired in a board game.

## Projects
I have separated it in 3 proyects:

* SnakesAndLadders: For the logic of the game.
* SnakesAndLadders.Tests: For the unit test.
* SnakesAndLadders.Console: To execute the game in a console application.

## The game
The game has a board of 100 squares. There are some snakes and laddres on the board. 

If a player lands on the bottom of a ladder, the player will arrive to the top of the ladder. If a player lands on the head of the snake, the player will arrive to the tail of the snake.

The snakes and the ladder are being generated randomly. In every game the ladders and the snakes can be in different positions.
